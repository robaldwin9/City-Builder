# City-Builder
 A procedural generated city that include variables for changing the city is built. Each buildings is give a random height as well as 
 texture for a more interesting effect. No collision detection is used to save expense ,and to make an interesting merge effect of 
 diffferent geometries.
  
## Uses threejs controller
Must use tab to change build variables. Feel free to adjust and see how everthying works.
